# Shelve

Shelve is service that allows cross platform p2p file sharing using Webrtc technology. It is mainly designed to be used with command line interface, but it has also web interface for easier navigation.

Checkout more on [shelve page](https://emiraganov.github.io/shelve/)


Some of key features:

- Run service anywhere and provide your users simple way of p2p sharing files
- Share directories/files super easy with CLI client
- Store, receive files under any path of shared directory
- Find file across all shared endpoints

## Why is build

Like every p2p file sharing it removes hassle with:

- having to upload every time on some remote storage just so that someone can download, or be limited with storage capacity.
- need to know device IP in order to send file
- limitation of usage on single platform


# Warning

Running signaling server on internet will make your files publically available. This version does not offer any protection on that!. Use only in your local network only! ;)
